    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "> Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and a subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to make computers understand human language. NLP uses computational linguistics, which is the study of how language works, and various models based on statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. ~ Geeks for Geeks\n",
    "\n",
    "*See the DeepLearning AI post for more **why**, what, and how*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math with Words\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deep learning models, being differentiable functions, can only process numeric tensors: they canâ€™t take raw text as input. *Vectorizing* text is the process of transforming text into numeric tensors.\n",
    "> ~ *Deep Learning with Python*\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Explore** the dataset to see understand what it contains.\n",
    "1. **Standardize** text to make it easier to process, such as by converting it to lowercase or removing formatting.\n",
    "2. **Tokenize** the text by splitting it into units.\n",
    "3. **Index** the tokens into a numerical vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "![From raw text to vectors, *Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Ed*, fig. 11.1](../img/deep_learning_with_python-fig-11-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not listed in the text book, but you should always begin with exploring the dataset to understand what it contains: data format and potential bias!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of standardization include converting to lowercase, standardizing punctuation and special characters, and stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{mermaid}\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "   A[\"My altitude is 7258\" above sea-level, far, far above that of West Point or Annapolis!\"] --> norm((\"Normalize Text\"))\n",
    "   B[\"My altitude is 7258 ft. above sea level, FAR FAR above that of west point or Annapolis!\"] --> norm\n",
    "   norm --> result[\"my altitude is 7258 feet above sea level far far above that of west point or annapolis !\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tokenize in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of **word-level** tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"my\", \"altitude\", \"is\", \"7258\", \"feet\", \"above\", \"sea\", \"level\", \"far\", \"far\", \"above\", \"that\", \"of\", \"west\", \"point\", \"or\", \"annapolis\", \"!\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of **bag-of-3-grams** tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"my altitude is\", \"altitude is 7258\", \"is 7258 feet\", \"7258 feet above\", \"feet above sea\", \"above sea level\", \"sea level far\", \"level far far\", \"far far above\", \"far above that\", \"above that of\", \"that of west\", \"of west point\", \"west point or\", \"point or annapolis\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to represent tokens in a vector is with the **bag-of-words** approach, which just counts how many times each token appears in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"my\": 1, \"altitude\": 1, \"is\": 1, \"7258\": 1, \"feet\": 1, \"above\": 2, \"sea\": 1, \"level\": 1, \"far\": 2, \"that\": 1, \"of\": 1, \"west\": 1, \"point\": 1, \"or\": 1, \"annapolis\": 1, \"!\": 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As simple as this is, it can be highly effective! However, you lose sequence information, which can be critical. Moving to N-grams can help!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequence models** are a more advanced method of retaining sequence information, for more advanced use-cases."

    "*TinyML* Chapter 8 details [feature generation](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/ch08.html#:-:text=How%20Does%20Feature%20Generation%20Work%3F) and how it is a sliding window of FFT.\n",

    "\n",
    "The chapter links to a colab notebook that doesn't exist anymore. Before it was deleted, it was [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5c7c11eeb4e046cd974e6984f4dd0910d099b2d0/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech/train/train_micro_speech_model.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "As shown in the previous lesson, the Arduino example works, but I cannot find anything to train a model to use different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model input is 40 x 49 because of how the window slides. This can be changed\n",
    "- I see no indication of a Hann Window being used like the book mentions\n",
    "- Manual normalization does happen\n",

    "This current tutorial, [Simple audio recognition: Recognizing keywords](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio), runs on colab *Have to unpin the libcudnn version to use GPU b/c new TF*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension `Input shape: (124, 129, 1)` gets resized to `32 x 32`. Makes me wonder if I could just resize to 40x49 to match Arduino.\n",
    "Not a power of 2, but then neither is the 28x28 digits set?\n",

    "**I think this is my best bet: train a model with proper input size here and then use cat-dog transfer learning style to binary classify for different words.\n",

# Lab 6: Prompt Engineering

## Pre-Reading

- [Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api)

### Objectives

- Explain hardware limits and challenges with LLMs.
- Employ simple prompt engineering tactics to produce better LLM results.

## Hardware Expenses

LLMs take **a lot of RAM**.

[Table: 8-bit quantized LLaMA requirements](https://aituts.com/local-llms/)

|   Model   | VRAM Used | Minimum Total VRAM |     Card examples     | RAM/Swap to Load* |
|:---------:|:---------:|:------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|
| LLaMA-7B  | 9.2GB     | 10GB               | 3060 12GB, 3080 10GB  | 24 GB             |
| LLaMA-13B | 16.3GB    | 20GB               | 3090, 3090 Ti, 4090   | 32 GB             |
| LLaMA-30B | 36GB      | 40GB               | A6000 48GB, A100 40GB | 64 GB             |
| LLaMA-65B | 74GB      | 80GB               | A100 80GB             | 128 GB            |

### Advanced Quantization

[Hugging Face Bits and Bytes](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) can make these models much smaller.

### Cost Containment for Generative AI

From DeepLearning AI's [*The Batch* newsletter](https://info.deeplearning.ai/ai-for-brain-surgery-microsofts-chatgpt-bill-googles-generative-phones-better-prompts)

> Microsoft is looking to control the expense of its reliance on OpenAI’s models.
>
> **What’s new:** Microsoft seeks to build leaner language models that perform nearly as well as ChatGPT but cost less to run, The Information reported.
>
> **How it works:** Microsoft offers a line of AI-powered tools that complement the company’s flagship products including Windows, Microsoft 365, and GitHub. Known as Copilot, the line is based on OpenAI models. Serving those models to 1 billion-plus users could amount to an enormous expense, and it occupies processing power that would be useful elsewhere. To manage the cost, Microsoft’s developers are using knowledge distillation, in which a smaller model is trained to mimic the output of a larger one, as well as other techniques.

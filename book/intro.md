> **ECE 386: AI Hardware Applications 3 (1)** Students will use Artificial Intelligence pipelines and frameworks to train and deploy machine learning models onto various computational platforms. Deployments will consider engineering tradeoffs between model size, hardware constraints, and system design grounded in an understanding of computer architecture. Students will use Python to implement training on cloud-based hardware accelerators. Inference will be conducted on microprocessor and GPU boards. Emphasis will also be placed on the balance of AI provided prediction with human provided judgment. Lab. Final project or final exam. Prerq: Comp Sci 110; ECE 281 or Comp Sci 351 or department approval. Sem hrs: 3 fall.

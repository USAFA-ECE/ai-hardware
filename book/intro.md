> **ECE 495: AI Hardware Applications 1.5 (1)** This course will require students to engage with Artificial Intelligence algorithms and frameworks to train and deploy machine learning models.
> Students will explore which types of problems are appropriate for AI to solve, data pipelining, hardware accelerated training, and inference on hardware and power constrained devices.
> Assignments may include system design, programming, and book reviews. Classes are organized as lecture and laboratories devoted to applying models.  Prereq: CompSci 110.  Sem hrs: 1.5

## Course Text

In addition to lots of online resources, we use [*TinyML*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/) by Pete Warden.

The book is **available for free** from O'Reilly via [DoD MWR Libraries](https://www.dodmwrlibraries.org/).

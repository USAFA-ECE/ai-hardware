    "2. The word \"walk\" is the base form for the word \"walking\", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization.\n",
    "3. The word \"meeting\" can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb (\"to meet\") depending on the context; e.g., \"in our last meeting\" or \"We are meeting again tomorrow\". Unlike stemming, lemmatization attempts to select the correct lemma depending on the context.\n",

# Dimensionality

## Pre-Reading

- [The Curse of Dimensionality: Why High Dimension Data Can be So Troublesome](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality-50dc6e49aa1e)

I also need you to understand what the mathematical term [tensor](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tensor) is.

> A tensor is a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to an arbitrary number of indices.

This guy is very good but you may want to speed up the video a tad:

- If you are new to linear algebra, watch the entire video [What's a Tensor](https://youtu.be/f5liqUk0ZTw)
- If you have experience in linear algebra, [start at 6:15](https://youtu.be/f5liqUk0ZTw?t=375)
- If you are seriously in a hurry watch at least [from 10:20](https://youtu.be/f5liqUk0ZTw?t=620)

### Objectives

1. Features exist in dimensions
2. More dimensions have consequences (data and compute requirements)
3. There exists ways to reduce dimensions

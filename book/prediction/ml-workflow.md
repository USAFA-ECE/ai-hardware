# Machine Learning Workflow

## Pre-Reading

*TinyML* Chapter 3: The Deep Learning Workflow

### Objectives

- Describe the ML workflow for embedded systems
- Apply the ML workflow for embedded systems

## The Machine Learning Workflow for Embedded Devices

There are several variations of this workflow.
This combines the workflow presented in *TinyML* Chapter 3 with
[TensorFlow Tutorial: Transfer learning and fine-tuning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning).

1. Decide on a goal
2. Collect a dataset
    - Examine and understand the data
3. Design a model architecture
    - Consider the data input pipeline
4. Train the model
5. Convert the model
6. Run inference
7. Evaluate and troubleshoot

# Prediction Machines

> The current wave of advances in artificial intelligence doesn't actually bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence: prediction. ~ *Prediction Machines (4)*

## Pre-Reading

*TinyML* [Chapter 3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/ch03.html#:-:text=Chapter%203.%20Getting%20Up%20to%20Speed%20on%20Machine%20Learning):
Intro and "What Machine Learning Actually Is."

### Objectives

- Understand that AI is fundamentally prediction.
- Understand that prediction combines with human judgement to result in a decision.

## Machine Learning as an Algorithm

> The machine learning algorithm builds a *model* of the system based on the data we provide, through a process we call *training*.
> The model is a type of computer program. We run data through this model to make predictions, in a process called *inference*. *~ TinyML*

## Machine Learning as Economics

> Having better prediction raises the value of judgement. ~ *Prediction Machines (95)*

Computers made arithmetic cheap.

Internet made distribution, communication, and search cheap.

AI has made prediction cheap.

A drop in price of one thing can increase the price of its complements. For example, cheaper coffee means more expensive cream and sugar.

**Prediction** is the process of filling in missing information. Prediction takes information you have, often called "data," and uses it to generate information you don't have.
